# User service

This is the user service of turnazos. The project is just starting out, soon I will publish the API docs

## How to get started

If you are going to work only with this service, you have to create a .env file and pass the variables listed [in here](https://github.com/Turnazos/user_service/tree/src/config/env) and run `yarn run dev`.
