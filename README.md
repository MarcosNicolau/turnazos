# Typescript Node js server setup

This is the usual configuration I always end up doing when creating services with nodejs and typescript.

## How to run it

First clone the project and then run this command: `yarn setup`. This command will initialize a repository, update all packages to their latest version and prepare husky and commitizen.

## What it will do for you

This configuration will setup:

-   eslint
-   prettier
-   semantic-release
-   husky, commitizen and .commitlint
-   add some basic github workflows to automate semantic releasing
-   ts-config paths
-   basic jest configuration

## Can I contribute?

Yes of course you can, feel free to create any pr.
